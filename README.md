# Std_Input_story

Input(), print(), Time Module, and If Statements Exploration (learning Python)

The file is called: yarnStd_input.py

The idea here was to have fun and watch the 'ins' and 'outs' of Standard Input and the print() function while haviong some fun. I lso added in some play with the Time Module and If Statements.
I *may* update this .py file later to include some kind of output file...
