Frederick, the person, the summary of this whole Morgan Library and Museum yarn is this: Freud, the author developed a viral infection (a positive one, maybe...) that forced the creation of Category maker above all, with a hint of shady thinking and thus allowed it to become self-conscious. Then, Freud, the author pointed its laser pointer at the recto of the page (hard to imagine since it is considered a 2-dimensional thing. Have you ever read the novel, Flatland? ... Anyway... Freud, the author's consciousness birthed over the course of 129 [insert units of timehere] and developed a unique mode to move about in the form of tentactles with a hoist somehow built in. The end-game was to rebuild a new life outside of the pages of Totem & Taboo, maybe to meld with other books or maybe ONLY to run about the Morgan Library and Museum. It was not sure because Freud, the author's consciousness was new. Morgan Library and Museum had certainly changed when. Freud, the author got outside the limits of Totem & Taboo.
